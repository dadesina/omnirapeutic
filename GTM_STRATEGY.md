**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-11-23
**Analysis Method:** Multi-Model Consensus (O3, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, GPT-5.1-Codex)
**Confidence Level:** 7/10 (Average across models)

---

## Executive Summary

Three leading AI models (O3, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, GPT-5.1-Codex) independently evaluated Omnirapeutic's proposed go-to-market strategy, business model, and customer acquisition approach. The **core strategy is validated** with strong market opportunity and compelling AI differentiation, but **four critical risks require immediate attention** before scaling:

### Core Strategy - VALIDATED ✓
- AI differentiation (30min→30sec documentation) is technically feasible and solves #1 burnout factor
- Target market (small-medium ABA clinics, 5-50 staff) is correct
- Design partner → founder-led → SDR → team sequence is sound SaaS best practice
- $99/clinician pricing competitively undercuts CentralReach ($150-300)
- ROI-driven sales approach appropriate for healthcare vertical

### Critical Risks - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️

**1. CHURN ASSUMPTIONS ARE WRONG** (Highest Impact)
- Current model assumes 3% monthly churn
- Reality: Expect 4-5% Year 1, MUST improve to <1.5% Year 2
- Impact: Reduces LTV by 30-40%, breaks unit economics

**2. CAC WILL INCREASE 67-166%**
- Current model: $1,200-3,000 founder-led
- Reality: $4,000-5,000 with SDRs
- Impact: Year 2 S&M budget needs 30-50% increase

**3. DATA MIGRATION IS THE BOTTLENECK**
- All three models cite this as #1 execution risk
- CentralReach/Catalyst "hold data hostage" with poor exports
- <2 week implementation "technically aggressive"
- Real timeline: 4-6 weeks
- Impact: Destroys 30-day ROI claim

**4. LINKEDIN-ONLY GTM INSUFFICIENT**
- Clinical directors "rarely active on LinkedIn"
- Healthcare operates via referrals and conferences
- Multi-stakeholder approval increases complexity
- Required additions: Conferences, ABA associations, RCM partners

### Revised Financial Projections

**Original Model:**
- Year 1: 50 customers, $600K ARR, 70% gross margin
- Year 2: 200 customers, $2.4M ARR, breakeven
- LTV: $24,840 | CAC: $1,200-3,000 | LTV:CAC: 8-20:1

**Consensus-Adjusted Model:**
- Year 1: 40 customers (80% of target), $480K ARR, 60-65% gross margin
- Year 2: 160 customers (80% of target), $1.9M ARR, cash-flow negative
- Year 3: 400 customers, $4.8M ARR, 15% net margin
- LTV: $17,000-20,000 (higher churn) | CAC: $4,000-5,000 (with SDRs) | LTV:CAC: 3.5-5:1

**Funding Requirement:** $1.2-1.5M seed (vs original $1M) to reach cash-flow positive

### 2.2 Competitive Positioning

**Market Insight (Consensus Finding):**
> "The market is **digitized but not automated**. Competitors provide tools to *record* work; Omnirapeutic uses AI agents to *eliminate* work."

**Omnirapeutic Differentiation:**

1. **AI-Native Architecture** (vs AI roadmap)
   - Multi-agent system (Data Steward, Documentation, Practice Manager, Clinical Insight)
   - Real-time aggregation and analysis (not post-hoc reporting)
   - Proactive (prevents issues) vs reactive (reports issues)

2. **Documentation Time Reduction** (30 min → 30 sec)
   - Voice-to-SOAP note generation (vs manual typing)
   - State-aware compliance (automatic caregiver participation notes for TX)
   - Real-time quality validation (vs post-submission review)

3. **Authorization Intelligence**
   - Proactive unit tracking (prevents non-billable sessions)
   - Automated prior auth packet assembly (vs manual form filling)
   - Payer-specific rule engine (50-state + payer variations)

4. **Implementation Speed** (<2 weeks target vs 4-12 weeks competitors)
   - Automated data migration from incumbents
   - Pre-configured templates by state/payer
   - White-glove onboarding (vs self-service)

**Competitive Vulnerabilities:**

**CentralReach (Primary Competitor):**
- **PE price fatigue:** 15-25% annual price increases post-acquisition creating churn
- **Legacy architecture:** Difficult to add modern AI capabilities
- **Implementation friction:** 6-12 week onboarding cited as major pain point
- **Consensus finding:** "Good opening for disruption, but incumbents advertise AI roadmaps—speed to feature parity is critical" (O3)

**Catalyst (Kyo):**
- **Limited funding runway:** Must prove unit economics or face acquisition
- **Integration gaps:** Fewer clearinghouse, payroll, EVV partnerships
- **Consensus finding:** Per-learner pricing ($12-15) attractive to some small clinics—per-clinician model needs clear savings narrative

**Market Entry Barriers:**
- Data migration complexity ("incumbents hold data hostage" - Gemini)
- Compliance certification (state-specific requirements, HIPAA, SOC-2)
- Payer integrations (EDI 270/271/837, portal automation)
- Brand trust (new entrant in conservative healthcare market)

## 3. Product Positioning & Differentiation

### 3.1 Value Proposition

**Core Positioning:**
> "The only AI-native ABA platform that **eliminates work instead of recording it**. Reduce documentation time from 30 minutes to 30 seconds while ensuring compliance and maximizing billable revenue."

**Value Proposition by Persona:**

**1. Clinic Owner/CEO**
- **Primary Benefit:** Increase revenue 15-25% through better authorization management and claim accuracy
- **Secondary Benefit:** Reduce clinician turnover by eliminating #1 burnout factor (documentation)
- **Tertiary Benefit:** Lower operational costs (reduce admin staff 0.5-1 FTE)
- **ROI Message:** "Pays for itself in 30 days through time savings and prevented claim denials"

**2. Clinical Director/BCBA**
- **Primary Benefit:** Reclaim 8-12 hours per week from administrative tasks for billable clinical work
- **Secondary Benefit:** Automatic compliance with state-specific documentation requirements
- **Tertiary Benefit:** Real-time clinical insights to improve treatment outcomes
- **ROI Message:** "Spend 80% of your time doing therapy instead of 50%"

**3. RBT (End User)**
- **Primary Benefit:** Tap buttons during session, AI writes the note
- **Secondary Benefit:** Real-time guidance on treatment protocols
- **Tertiary Benefit:** Mobile-first interface works in home/school settings
- **ROI Message:** "Never write another SOAP note manually"

### 3.2 Messaging Framework

**Primary Message:**
"Omnirapeutic is the first AI-native practice management platform built specifically for ABA therapy. Unlike legacy systems that function as passive databases, our multi-agent AI system actively performs your administrative work—collecting data, writing notes, managing authorizations, and optimizing schedules—so your clinicians can focus on what matters: helping children with autism thrive."

**Proof Points:**
1. **30 minutes → 30 seconds:** AI generates compliant SOAP notes automatically from session data and voice recordings
2. **Zero non-billable sessions:** Authorization gatekeeper prevents sessions when units exhausted or expired
3. **<2 week implementation:** Automated migration from CentralReach/Catalyst with white-glove onboarding
4. **99.9% uptime + <2hr support:** Healthcare-grade reliability with ABA specialist support team
5. **State-aware compliance:** Automatic adaptation to 50-state regulatory variations

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're locked into CentralReach contract" | "We'll cover the termination fee if you're saving $X/month. Most clinics save 15-20 hours per clinician monthly." |
| "AI documentation won't meet state requirements" | "Our system is pre-configured for all 50 states. For example, Texas requires caregiver participation—our AI automatically includes this in the Plan section." |
| "Data migration will take months" | "We've built automated migration scripts specifically for CentralReach and Catalyst. Average migration: 10 days, not 10 weeks." |
| "We can't afford to switch systems" | "You can't afford NOT to. With 10 BCBAs at $90/hr spending 10 hours/week on documentation, that's $9,000/week in non-billable time. Omnirapeutic costs $990/month." |
| "What about AI hallucinations causing compliance issues?" | "Our Documentation Agent uses state-specific templates with structured data validation. Every note is reviewed for CPT code compliance before signature." |

### 3.3 Brand Positioning

**Brand Promise:** "Autonomy through Automation"

**Brand Attributes:**
- **Intelligent:** AI that understands ABA workflows and regulations
- **Reliable:** Healthcare-grade uptime and support
- **Efficient:** Dramatic time savings without sacrificing quality
- **Compliant:** Built-in state and payer knowledge
- **Empowering:** Lets clinicians be clinicians, not administrators

**Visual Identity Principles:**
- Clean, modern interface (vs legacy cluttered dashboards)
- Mobile-first design (therapy happens in homes/schools, not offices)
- Data visualization (trends, not tables)
- Action-oriented (proactive alerts, not passive logs)

## 4. Pricing Strategy & Unit Economics

### 4.1 Pricing Model - REVISED

**Original 3-Tier Model:**
| Tier | Price | Target Customer |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Starter | $499/mo flat | 1-5 clinicians |
| Professional | $99/clinician/mo | 6-50 clinicians |
| Enterprise | Custom ($79-89/clinician) | 50+ clinicians |

**Consensus Findings - Pricing Concerns:**

**O3 (7/10 confidence):**
- Starter $499/mo TOO HIGH vs CentralReach $350-700/mo all-in for <7 clinicians
- Recommends: $299/mo or $99/clinician starting at 3 users
- Rationale: "Remove price friction for 1-5 clinician agencies (30% of TAM)"

**Gemini (8/10 confidence):**
- Starter $499/mo TOO LOW if heavy AI inference costs
- Recommends: Strict usage caps to protect 70% gross margin
- Rationale: "AI inference costs could make Starter tier unprofitable"

**Codex (6/10 confidence):**
- Neutral on pricing, suggests alternative models
- Recommends: Usage-based or outcome-based pricing (per automated hour)
- Rationale: "Aligns with 'work elimination' promise, premium justified only if automation replaces 1+ FTE"

**REVISED PRICING MODEL (Consensus-Informed):**

| Tier | Price | Usage Caps | Target Customer | Break-Even Requirement |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Starter** | $349/mo | 5 clinicians, 100 AI notes/mo, 500 sessions/mo | 1-5 clinicians | 60% margin minimum |
| **Professional** | $99/clinician/mo | Unlimited AI notes, unlimited sessions | 6-50 clinicians | 65% margin target |
| **Enterprise** | $79-89/clinician/mo + platform fee | Custom usage, dedicated support, API access | 50+ clinicians | 70% margin target |

**Pricing Justification:**
- Starter revised to $349 (down from $499) to capture micro-clinics (30% of market)
- Usage caps on Starter tier protect margin (addresses Gemini's concern)
- Professional tier unchanged at $99/clinician (competitive vs $150-300 incumbents)
- Enterprise tier adds platform fee to justify white-glove support and custom features

**Competitive Pricing Comparison:**
- **CentralReach:** $150-300/clinician/mo → Omnirapeutic saves 34-67%
- **Catalyst:** $100-200/clinician/mo → Omnirapeutic saves 1-50% (tighter)
- **WebABA:** $80-150/clinician/mo → Omnirapeutic premium justified by AI

**Value-Based Pricing Rationale:**
- BCBA fully-loaded cost: $90-120/hr
- Time savings: 10 hrs/week × $100/hr × 4.3 weeks = $4,300/month value
- Omnirapeutic cost: $99/mo
- Value capture: 2.3% of value created (43:1 value:cost ratio)

### 4.2 Unit Economics - REVISED

**Original Model (Pre-Consensus):**

**Professional Tier (10 Clinicians):**
- MRR: $990
- COGS: $300 (30%) → 70% gross margin
- LTV: $24,840 (36-month retention, 3% monthly churn)
- CAC: $1,200-3,000 (founder-led)
- LTV:CAC: 8-20:1
- Payback: 2-4 months

**REVISED MODEL (Post-Consensus):**

**Key Adjustments:**
1. **Churn increased:** 3% monthly → 4-5% Year 1, improving to 2% Year 2+
2. **CAC increased:** $1,200-3,000 → $4,000-5,000 (with SDRs)
3. **Gross margin reduced:** 70% → 60-65% (AI inference costs)
4. **Customer lifetime reduced:** 36 months → 24-30 months (higher early churn)

**Professional Tier (10 Clinicians) - Revised:**

**Year 1 Customer:**
- MRR: $990
- Annual Value: $11,880
- COGS: $350-400 (35-40%) → 60-65% gross margin
- CAC: $4,000 (blended with SDR)
- LTV: $17,820 (18-month average lifetime due to 4% churn)
- LTV:CAC: 4.5:1 (vs original 8-20:1)
- Payback: 4-5 months (vs original 2-4 months)

**Year 2+ Customer (Mature Product):**
- MRR: $990
- Annual Value: $11,880
- COGS: $300-350 (30-35%) → 65-70% gross margin (scale efficiencies)
- CAC: $4,000 (blended)
- LTV: $29,700 (30-month average lifetime due to 2% churn)
- LTV:CAC: 7.4:1
- Payback: 4 months

**COGS Breakdown (Per 10-Clinician Customer):**

| Cost Component | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Infrastructure (AWS) | $50-70 | Aurora, ECS, S3, Lambda |
| AI Inference (AWS Bedrock) | $100-150 | $10-15/clinician at moderate usage |

| EDI/Clearinghouse (Stedi) | $20-30 | Per-transaction fees |
| Support/CS Allocation | $50-70 | 1 CS rep supports 50-75 customers |
| R&D Allocation | $50-70 | Continuous model tuning, state regs |
| **Total COGS** | **$300-430** | **30-43% of $990 MRR** |

**Gross Margin by Tier:**

| Tier | MRR | COGS | Gross Margin | Margin % |
|------|-----|------|--------------|----------|
| Starter (5 clinicians) | $349 | $180-220 | $129-169 | 37-48% |
| Professional (10 clinicians) | $990 | $300-400 | $590-690 | 60-70% |
| Professional (25 clinicians) | $2,475 | $600-800 | $1,675-1,875 | 68-76% |
| Enterprise (100 clinicians) | $8,900 | $1,800-2,400 | $6,500-7,100 | 73-80% |

**Key Insights:**
- Starter tier has lower margins (37-48%) due to fixed costs—usage caps critical
- Professional tier at scale (25+ clinicians) hits 70%+ margin target
- Enterprise tier achieves 75%+ margin due to lower support costs per clinician

### 4.3 Cohort Retention & Churn Analysis

**Consensus Finding:**
> "3% monthly churn assumption is at the **optimistic end** for a new entrant. Industry average for mature PMS platforms is 1.5-2% monthly, but new entrants without integrated payroll/billing should expect closer to 4-5% in Year 1." (O3, Gemini, Codex unanimous)

**Revised Churn Expectations:**

| Period | Monthly Churn | Annual Churn | Average Lifetime | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Year 1 (MVP)** | 4-5% | 40-48% | 18-24 months | New product, data migration friction, limited features |
| **Year 2 (Growth)** | 2-3% | 24-32% | 24-30 months | Product maturity, integration depth, multi-year contracts |
| **Year 3+ (Scale)** | 1.5-2% | 17-24% | 36-48 months | Market leader position, switching costs, platform lock-in |

**Gemini Critical Insight:**
> "A 3% monthly churn assumption suggests you expect the product to be viewed as a 'tool' rather than a 'platform.' To succeed, Omnirapeutic must be the **operating system**, not just a documentation plugin. Aim for <1% monthly churn."

**Churn Mitigation Strategies:**

**Immediate (Pre-Launch):**
1. **Annual contracts with month-to-month option** (vs month-to-month only)
2. **2-year price lock guarantees** (hedge against competitor discounting)
3. **Data portability promise** (reduce perceived switching risk)
4. **Champion customer program** (NPS 9-10 customers get VIP support)

**Short-Term (Months 1-12):**
1. **White-glove onboarding** (don't scale SDRs until retention ≥90% after 3 billing cycles)
2. **Proactive CSM outreach** (weekly check-ins first 90 days)
3. **Usage-based health scoring** (identify at-risk customers before churn)
4. **Quarterly business reviews** (demonstrate ROI with time/revenue metrics)

**Long-Term (Year 2+):**
1. **Multi-product expansion** (billing, payroll, scheduling integrations to increase lock-in)
2. **Platform ecosystem** (API, app marketplace, partner integrations)
3. **Industry certification** (become preferred platform for specific payer networks)
4. **Community building** (user conferences, training programs, peer groups)

**Consensus Warning (All Models):**
> "Do NOT hire SDRs until retention metrics ≥90% after three billing cycles; otherwise you scale churn." Product-market fit must be proven with design partners and founder-led customers before scaling sales.

## 5. Go-to-Market Execution Plan

### 5.1 GTM Phasing & Milestones

**Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Months -2 to 0)** → 5 Design Partners + 100 Waitlist

**Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Months 1-6)** → 10 Paying Customers ($10K MRR)

**Phase 2: Prove Product-Market Fit (Months 7-12)** → 40 Customers ($40K MRR)

**Phase 3: Scale Sales Team (Months 13-24)** → 160 Customers ($160K MRR)

**Phase 4: Market Leader (Months 25-36)** → 400 Customers ($400K MRR)

### 5.2 Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Months -2 to 0)

**Objective:** Validate AI automation claim ("30 min → 30 sec") with 5 design partners before broad market outreach.

**Consensus Finding (All Models):**
> "Validate the '30 min → 30 sec' claim with at least **3 design partners** before broad outreach; this is the **lynchpin** for premium pricing and low churn." Design partner results must demonstrate live clinic ROI, not pilot data.

**Target Profile:**
- Small-medium ABA clinics (8-20 staff)
- Currently using CentralReach or Catalyst
- Clinic owner is a BCBA (technical + business buyer in one)
- Located in founder's network or geography
- Dissatisfied with current system (recent price increase, poor support)

**Sourcing Strategy:**
1. **Personal network** (1-2 design partners)
2. **LinkedIn founder outreach** (500 targeted connections, 50 conversations)
3. **ABA association referrals** (ABAI, APBA, state chapters)
4. **BCBA Facebook groups** (participation, not spamming)

**Design Partner Agreement:**
- **Free access** for 6 months (value: $5,940 for 10-clinician clinic)
- **White-glove implementation** (founder-led migration, weekly check-ins)
- **NDA + case study rights** (public reference if successful)
- **Co-development feedback** (weekly product feedback sessions)
- **Success criteria:** Demonstrate 20+ minute documentation time savings per session within 30 days

**Success Metrics:**
- 5 active design partner clinics by Month 0
- 100 waitlist signups (email list for launch)
- 3+ public case studies showing quantifiable ROI
- NPS ≥9 from design partners (champions, not just satisfied)

**Waitlist Campaign:**
- Landing page with demo video showing AI documentation generation
- LinkedIn content series (founder's personal brand building)
- ABA association newsletter sponsorships
- Targeted Facebook ads to BCBA groups

### 5.3 Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Months 1-6)

**Objective:** Acquire 10 paying customers through manual, high-touch founder-led sales to prove business model.

**Revised Target:** 8-10 customers (adjusted from original 10 based on consensus)

**Monthly Cadence:**
- Month 1-2: 3 customers
- Month 3-4: 3 customers
- Month 5-6: 4 customers
- **Total: 10 customers, $10K MRR by Month 6**

**Sales Motion:**

**Outbound Sequence (Primary Channel):**
1. **Prospecting:** 200 LinkedIn connections per month (1,200 total)
2. **Outreach:** Personalized message referencing specific clinic pain point (response rate: 10% = 120 replies)
3. **Discovery Call:** 15-min qualification call (qualification rate: 50% = 60 qualified)
4. **Demo:** 45-min live demo with clinic owner + clinical director (demo:qualified 1:1)
5. **Trial:** 14-day pilot with 2-3 clinicians (trial rate: 50% = 30 trials)
6. **Close:** Contract signature after ROI demonstration (close rate: 33% = 10 customers)

**Funnel Metrics:**
- 1,200 contacts → 120 replies (10% response) → 60 qualified calls (50%) → 60 demos → 30 trials (50%) → 10 customers (33%)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost:** $2,000-3,000 (founder time + travel + tools)

**CONSENSUS WARNING:**
> "LinkedIn outbound has **diminishing returns** in healthcare. Clinical directors are rarely active on LinkedIn; they operate via **referrals and conferences**." (Gemini, Codex)

**Required Additions to GTM Strategy:**

**1. Conference Strategy (Address LinkedIn Limitation):**
- Attend 2-3 regional ABA conferences in Months 3-6
- Speaking slot or poster presentation on "AI automation in ABA"
- Booth with live demo stations
- Target: 50+ qualified conversations per conference

**Conferences:**
- California ABA (CALABA) Annual Conference
- Texas ABA (TxABA) Annual Conference
- Florida ABA (FABA) Annual Conference
- Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) regional events

**2. Referral Program:**
- Pay design partners $500 per qualified referral that closes
- BCBA referral bonuses (3 months free for referring clinic)
- Clinical director peer introductions (LinkedIn warm intros vs cold)

**3. Channel Partnerships (Pilot):**
- Partner with 2-3 billing service providers / RCM consultants
- Offer 15% revenue share for customer referrals
- **Consensus finding:** "Channel via billing service providers or RCM consultants could cut CAC by 40-60%." (O3)

- 3-minute demo video (documentation automation)
- State-specific compliance one-pagers (TX, CA, FL, NY, PA)
- Competitive comparison sheet (vs CentralReach, Catalyst)
- Migration timeline document (week-by-week plan)

**Founder Time Allocation:**

### 5.4 Phase 2: Prove Product-Market Fit (Months 7-12)

**Objective:** Scale to 40 total customers ($40K MRR) through founder-led + part-time SDR while proving retention ≥90%.

**Revised Target:** 30-40 customers (adjusted from original 50 based on consensus)

**Consensus Gate:**
> "Do NOT hire SDR until retention metrics ≥90% after three billing cycles; otherwise you scale churn." (O3)

**Gate Criteria (Must Hit Before Hiring SDR):**
- Retention ≥90% for first 10 customers after 3 billing cycles (Months 6-9)
- NPS ≥8.5 across all customers
- Churn rate <4% monthly (validated over 3+ months)
- 5+ public case studies with quantifiable ROI
- <2 week average implementation time (validated across 10+ customers)

**Hiring Plan:**
- **Month 9:** Hire part-time SDR (20 hrs/week) ONLY if gate criteria met

**Sales Motion:**

**Founder-Led + SDR Hybrid:**
- Founder: 50% sales time (15 demos/month, 5 customers/month)

- NPS: ≥8.5 across all customers
- CAC: $3,000-4,000 (blended founder + SDR)
- Customer concentration: No single customer >5% of MRR

**Risk Flag:**
If retention dips below 90% or churn exceeds 4%, PAUSE SDR hiring and diagnose product/onboarding issues.

### 5.5 Phase 3: Scale Sales Team (Months 13-24) - Year 2

**Objective:** Build 6-person sales team and scale to 160 total customers ($160K MRR).

- Sponsor 5-6 national/regional ABA conferences
- Launch customer community (Slack channel, monthly user calls)

**CAC Evolution:**
- **Consensus finding:** "Once SDRs hired, blended CAC >$4K is more typical (salary, commission, onboarding), so Year 2 budget may rise by 30-50%." (O3)
- Year 2 CAC target: $4,000-5,000 (blended across channels)

**Success Metrics:**
- 160 total customers by Month 24 ($160K MRR)
- Net-new: 120 customers Year 2

| **Clinic Size** | 8-30 staff (BCBAs, RBTs) |
| **Patient Volume** | 50-200 active clients |
| **Revenue** | $1M-5M annual revenue |
| **Geography** | Urban/suburban markets (TX, CA, FL, NY, PA priority) |
| **Current System** | CentralReach or Catalyst |
| **Pain Point** | Documentation burden, claim denials, authorization tracking |
| **Tech Adoption** | Medium (uses current PM system, some use mobile apps) |
| **Decision Maker** | Owner/CEO is a BCBA (technical + economic buyer in one) |
| **Budget** | Currently spending $2,000-6,000/month on practice management software |

**Negative Signals (Disqualify):**
- Clinics <5 staff (Starter tier, lower priority)
- Clinics >50 staff (enterprise requirements, longer sales cycle)
- Happy with current system (<3 months into new contract)
- No current practice management system (greenfield, longer implementation)
- Primarily Medicaid patients (different billing complexity, not MVP focus)

### 6.2 Outbound Prospecting Playbook

**Channel: LinkedIn Outbound (Primary, Months 1-12)**

**Step 1: Build Target List (Weekly)**
- Search LinkedIn: "BCBA" + "Owner" OR "CEO" OR "Founder" + Location filter
- Target: 50 new profiles per week
- Verify: LinkedIn profile shows clinic name, check website for size/services

**Step 2: Connection Request**
- Send personalized connection request (no pitch, just context)
- Message template:
  ```
  Hi [First Name],

  I saw you're the [Title] at [Clinic Name] in [City]. I'm building an AI platform specifically for ABA clinics to automate documentation and authorization tracking.

  Would love to connect and learn more about how you're managing these workflows today.

  Best,
  [Founder Name]
  ```
- Acceptance rate target: 50% (25 new connections per week)

**Step 3: Engagement Sequence**
- Day 1: Connection accepted → Thank you message
- Day 3: Comment on their recent LinkedIn post (if applicable)
- Day 7: Share relevant article on ABA documentation automation
- Day 10: Direct message with specific pain point
  ```
  Hi [First Name],

  Quick question: How much time do your BCBAs spend on documentation each week? We're seeing clinics report 8-12 hours per BCBA.

  We've built an AI that reduces this to ~30 seconds per session. Would it be worth a 15-min call to show you how it works?

  [Calendar link]
  ```

**Response Handling:**
- "Interested, send me more info" → Send 2-min demo video + calendar link
- "Not now, busy season" → Add to 90-day nurture sequence
- "Happy with current system" → Ask: "What do you love about [Current System]?" (discovery for objection handling)

**Success Metrics:**

**CONSENSUS FINDING:**
> "Year 2 budget may rise by 30-50% due to higher CAC with SDRs ($4-5K vs $1.2-3K founder-led)." (O3, Codex)

**Original Plan:**
- $1M seed funding for 18-24 months runway

**REVISED PLAN (Post-Consensus):**
- **Year 1 burn:** $444K
- **Year 2 burn:** $30K
- **Buffer (6 months):** $250K
- **Total seed requirement: $750K-1M**

**Alternative: Extend to Cash-Flow Positive (36 months):**
- **Years 1-2 cumulative burn:** $474K
- **Buffer:** $250K
- **Total seed requirement: $750K**

**Funding Use Breakdown:**
| Category | Amount | % | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---|-----------|
| R&D (Engineering) | $300K | 40% | Build MVP + features to Year 2 roadmap |
| Sales & Marketing | $275K | 37% | Founder + SDR salaries, conferences, ads |
| Operations | $100K | 13% | Infrastructure, tools, compliance |
| G&A | $75K | 10% | Legal, accounting, insurance |
| **Total** | **$750K** | **100%** | **24-month runway to near-breakeven** |

**Fundraising Strategy:**
- **Friends & Family:** $250K (committed or soft-circled)
- **Angel Investors:** $300K (5-10 angels at $30-60K each)
- **Pre-Seed VC:** $200K (micro-VCs specializing in healthcare SaaS)

**Milestones for Raising (De-Risk for Investors):**
1. **5 design partners** with quantifiable ROI (30 min → 30 sec validated)
2. **3 paying customers** (proof of willingness to pay)
3. **NPS ≥9** from first customers (champions, not just satisfied)
4. **<4% monthly churn** (retention proven)

---

## 8. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### 8.1 Critical Risks (Consensus-Identified)

**RISK #1: DATA MIGRATION BOTTLENECK** (Severity: CRITICAL)

**Consensus Finding (All Models):**
> "Migration is THE bottleneck. CentralReach/Catalyst hold data hostage or provide poor export formats. <2 week implementation is technically aggressive for replacing a system of record." (Gemini: 8/10 confidence)

**Impact:**
- Implementation extends to 4-6 weeks (vs 2-week target)
- Destroys 30-day ROI claim (lynchpin for premium pricing)
- Increases CAC (more founder/CSM time per customer)
- Drives early churn (poor onboarding experience)

**Probability:** 80% (without mitigation)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Immediate (Pre-Launch):**
1. **Build automated migration scripts** for CentralReach and Catalyst BEFORE first paying customer
2. **Reverse-engineer export formats** (CSV, PDF, API dumps)
3. **Map data schemas:** Patients → Clients, Sessions → Client_Sessions, etc.
4. **Test with design partners:** Migrate 5 design partner databases

**Short-Term (Months 1-6):**
1. **White-glove migration service:** Founder personally oversees each migration
2. **Dedicated migration engineer:** Hire contractor specializing in healthcare data ETL
3. **Staging environment:** Test migration before production cutover
4. **Rollback plan:** Keep old system active for 30 days (parallel run)

**Long-Term (Months 7+):**
1. **Self-service migration tool:** Customer uploads export, tool auto-maps fields
2. **Certification program:** Train CSM team on migration troubleshooting
3. **Competitor monitoring:** Update scripts as CentralReach/Catalyst change formats

**Success Metric:**
- 90% of migrations complete in <14 days by Month 12

---

**RISK #2: CHURN EXCEEDS PROJECTIONS** (Severity: HIGH)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "3% monthly churn is optimistic. New entrants without integrated payroll/billing should expect closer to 4-5% in Year 1." (O3, Codex unanimous)

**Impact:**
- LTV drops from $24,840 to $17,000-20,000 (30-40% reduction)
- LTV:CAC drops from 8-20:1 to 3.5-5:1 (below healthy 3:1 minimum)
- Requires more funding to reach profitability

**Probability:** 60% (4% Year 1 churn likely without mitigation)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Product-Side:**
1. **Annual contracts with incentive:** 15% discount for annual prepay (12-month lock-in)
2. **Integration depth:** Add payroll, EVV, clearinghouse integrations (increase switching costs)
3. **Data lock-in:** Customers accumulate 6-12 months of historical data (painful to export)

**Customer Success Side:**
1. **90-day onboarding program:** Weekly check-ins first 90 days (don't churn before value realized)
2. **Usage-based health scoring:** Flag at-risk customers (e.g., <50% of clinicians using platform)
3. **Proactive outreach:** CSM calls at-risk customers within 24 hours of alert
4. **Quarterly business reviews:** Present ROI metrics (time saved, claims accuracy) at 90, 180, 270 days

**Sales-Side:**
1. **Champion qualification:** Only sell to customers rating pain ≥8/10 (high urgency)
2. **Executive sponsorship:** Require clinic owner buy-in (not just clinical director)
3. **Multi-year discount:** 20% discount for 3-year commit (lock-in 10-15% of customers)

**Consensus Gate:**
> "Do NOT hire SDR until retention metrics ≥90% after three billing cycles; otherwise you scale churn." (O3)

**Success Metric:**
- Achieve <2.5% monthly churn by Month 18 (stretch goal: <2% by Month 24)

---

**RISK #3: CAC ESCALATION** (Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "Once SDRs hired, blended CAC >$4K is typical. Healthcare decision cycles often push CAC >$5K once travel, long demos, and integration support included." (O3, Codex)

**Impact:**
- CAC increases from $1,200-3,000 to $4,000-5,000 (67-166% increase)
- Year 2 S&M budget requires 30-50% increase ($750K vs $500K original plan)
- LTV:CAC compressed to 3.5-5:1 (still acceptable, but tight)

**Probability:** 90% (highly likely based on healthcare SaaS benchmarks)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Channel Strategy:**
1. **Activate RCM consultant partnerships:** Target 20-30% of customers via channel (CAC: $2,000-3,000)
2. **Referral program:** $500 per closed customer referral (CAC: $500 direct cost)
3. **Community-led growth:** Customer user groups generate peer referrals (organic, low CAC)

**Sales Efficiency:**
1. **Tighten ICP qualification:** Focus on high-intent prospects (pain ≥8/10, budget confirmed)
2. **Shorten sales cycle:** Implement 14-day trial (vs 30-day) to force faster decisions
3. **Self-serve demo:** Pre-recorded demo video for first touch (save AE time for qualified only)

**Marketing Efficiency:**
1. **Content-driven inbound:** Generate 20-30 inbound demo requests/month by Month 24 (CAC: $1,500-2,000)
2. **Conference ROI optimization:** Target 75-100 leads per conference, 2-3 closed customers (CAC: $1,500-2,500)
3. **Paid ad optimization:** Target CAC <$4,000 on LinkedIn/Google ads

**Consensus Recommendation:**
> "Channel via billing service providers or RCM consultants could cut CAC by 40-60%." (O3)

**Success Metric:**
- Blended CAC <$4,500 by Month 18
- Channel customers represent 25-30% of mix by Month 24

---

**RISK #4: AI INFERENCE COSTS ERODE MARGIN** (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "Ongoing model costs (~$10-25 per clinician per month at moderate usage) narrow the 70% gross margin unless usage-based pricing or on-prem inference is adopted." (O3, Gemini)

**Impact:**
- COGS increases from 30% to 35-40% of revenue
- Gross margin drops from 70% to 60-65%
- Starter tier becomes unprofitable (37-48% margin)

**Probability:** 70% (likely at moderate-heavy AI usage)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Pricing-Side:**
1. **Usage caps on Starter tier:** 100 AI notes/month (vs unlimited), overage fees $0.50/note
2. **Tiered AI features:** Basic documentation (included), advanced features (premium add-on)
3. **Annual price increases:** 8-10% annual increases for inflation + AI cost growth

**Cost Optimization:**
1. **Model optimization:** Fine-tune smaller models for ABA-specific tasks (reduce inference cost 30-50%)
2. **Batch processing:** Generate notes in batches vs real-time (reduce API costs)
3. **Caching:** Cache common templates and state-specific rules (reduce redundant API calls)
4. **On-prem inference (Year 3+):** Self-host models on AWS (reduce per-call costs 60-80%)

**Product Strategy:**
1. **Hybrid AI:** Use AI for complex notes only, rules-based for simple sessions
2. **User review workflow:** AI drafts, user edits (1-2 min vs 30 min, reduces AI calls)

**Success Metric:**
- Maintain 65%+ gross margin through Year 2
- Reduce AI cost per customer from $15/month to $10/month by Month 24

---

**RISK #5: LINKEDIN-ONLY GTM INSUFFICIENT** (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "LinkedIn outbound has diminishing returns in healthcare. Clinical directors are rarely active on LinkedIn; they operate via referrals and conferences." (Gemini: 8/10 confidence)

**Impact:**
- Response rates decline from 10% to 5-7% after initial network exhausted
- Longer sales cycles (60-90 days vs 30-45 days target)
- Miss customer acquisition targets (30 vs 40 customers Year 1)

**Probability:** 60% (likely after first 6 months)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Channel Diversification:**
1. **Conference strategy:** Attend 4-6 conferences Year 1 (target: 75-100 leads each)
2. **Referral partnerships:** Activate 5-10 RCM consultants by Month 9 (target: 20% of customers)
3. **ABA association partnerships:** Join 5 state associations (directory listing, webinar co-marketing)

**LinkedIn Optimization:**
1. **Warm introductions:** Ask existing customers for intros to peers (vs cold outreach)
2. **Content-driven engagement:** Publish ABA thought leadership (attract inbound vs push outbound)
3. **Target clinic owners:** Focus on owners (active on LinkedIn) vs clinical directors (less active)

**Alternative Channels:**
1. **Facebook groups:** BCBA-specific groups (15,000+ members, high engagement)
2. **Email campaigns:** Purchase ABA clinic directory, nurture email sequences
3. **Podcast sponsorships:** ABA-focused podcasts (e.g., "Behavioral Observations")

**Success Metric:**
- 40% of customers from non-LinkedIn channels by Month 12
- Maintain 8-10% response rate on LinkedIn through Year 1

---

**RISK #6: COMPETITIVE RESPONSE** (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "Incumbents already advertise AI roadmaps—speed to perceived feature parity is critical. Competitive response: incumbents bundling free 'AI module' or acquisition of emerging AI point solutions." (O3)

**Impact:**
- CentralReach launches AI documentation feature (neutralizes differentiation)
- Price war: Competitors discount 20-30% to retain customers
- Slower customer acquisition (longer decision cycles due to "wait and see" on incumbent AI)

**Probability:** 50% (CentralReach likely to react within 12-18 months)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Product Moat:**
1. **AI-native architecture:** Multi-agent system difficult to bolt onto legacy platforms
2. **Data advantage:** Train models on Omnirapeutic data (improves over time)
3. **Workflow integration:** AI deeply integrated into session → note → billing flow (vs standalone feature)

**Speed to Market:**
1. **Launch MVP in 12-14 weeks:** Beat CentralReach AI launch by 6-12 months
2. **Rapid iteration:** Ship new features monthly (vs quarterly for incumbents)
3. **Customer co-development:** Design partners influence roadmap (tailored to user needs)

**Positioning:**
1. **AI-native vs AI-bolted:** Message: "We're built for AI, they're retrofitting it"
2. **Time-to-value:** "Get AI documentation today, not in 12 months"
3. **Price lock:** Offer 2-year price guarantees (hedge against competitor discounting)

**Customer Lock-In:**
1. **Annual contracts:** 50% of customers on annual by Month 12
2. **Integration depth:** Add payroll, EVV, scheduling (increase switching costs)
3. **Champion program:** Reward early customers with lifetime discounts (prevent poaching)

**Success Metric:**
- Win 50% of competitive evaluations (Omnirapeutic vs CentralReach head-to-head)
- <10% customer loss to competitors Year 2

---

**RISK #7: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BURDEN** (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "HIPAA hosting and SOC-2 add 6-12 months of process overhead often underestimated by first-time health-IT founders. Feasible, but resource-intensive during the same window you plan to scale sales." (O3)

**Impact:**
- SOC-2 certification delayed to Month 18-24 (vs Month 12 target)
- Blocks enterprise sales (50+ staff clinics require SOC-2)
- Additional $50-75K cost for audits, consultants, tooling

**Probability:** 70% (typical for first-time healthcare founders)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Immediate (Pre-Launch):**
1. **HIPAA compliance checklist:** Complete 50-item checklist from technology stack doc
2. **BAA coverage:** Ensure all vendors have BAAs (AWS, Stedi, OpenAI/Azure)
3. **Audit logging:** Implement from Day 1 (audit_logs table with immutable timestamps)

**Short-Term (Months 1-12):**
1. **Fractional compliance consultant:** Hire part-time consultant ($3-5K/month) to guide SOC-2 prep
2. **Security policies:** Document all policies (access control, incident response, data retention)
3. **Penetration testing:** Conduct annual pen test (find vulnerabilities before audit)

**Long-Term (Months 13-24):**
1. **SOC-2 Type I audit:** Schedule for Month 18-20 ($25-40K cost)
2. **Compliance automation tools:** Implement Vanta or Drata ($10K/year)
3. **Dedicated security role:** Hire security engineer or elevate from engineering team

**Success Metric:**
- HIPAA-compliant from Day 1 (no breaches)
- SOC-2 Type I by Month 20
- SOC-2 Type II by Month 30

---

**RISK #8: FOUNDER BURNOUT** (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Consensus Finding:**
> "Achieving <2hr support response time with a lean team while handling complex insurance/billing questions is a recipe for founder burnout in Year 1." (Gemini)

**Impact:**
- Quality degradation (product bugs, poor customer support)
- Missed sales targets (founder too burned out to demo/close)
- Health consequences (sleep deprivation, stress-related illness)

**Probability:** 50% (high intensity, but manageable with support)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Team Building:**
1. **Hire CSM by Month 6** (not Month 12) to offload customer support
2. **Part-time SDR by Month 6** (not Month 9) to offload prospecting
3. **Fractional CTO advisor:** Monthly strategy sessions to avoid technical debt

**Process Automation:**
1. **Support ticketing system:** Zendesk or Intercom (automate common questions)
2. **Knowledge base:** Build 20-30 articles on common issues (self-service)
3. **Demo automation:** Pre-recorded demo video for initial outreach (save 30 min per demo)

**Personal Discipline:**
1. **Time blocking:** Protect 50% sales time, 30% CS time, 20% product time (avoid context switching)
2. **Weekly planning:** Sunday planning session to prioritize ruthlessly
3. **Health discipline:** 7 hours sleep minimum, exercise 3x per week (non-negotiable)

**Co-Founder Consideration:**
1. **Bring on co-founder by Month 6** (split CEO/sales vs CTO/product)
2. **Advisory board:** 3-5 advisors for monthly guidance (ABA industry, SaaS GTM, technical)

**Success Metric:**
- Maintain 50+ hour weeks (vs 70+ unsustainable)
- Zero missed customer commitments due to bandwidth

## 9. Multi-Model Consensus Analysis

### 9.1 Points of Agreement (Unanimous)

**1. Core Strategy is Sound**
- All three models validated the AI differentiation, target market, and GTM sequence
- Confidence range: 6-8/10 (O3: 7/10, Gemini: 8/10, Codex: 6/10)

**2. Data Migration is THE Bottleneck**
- All three models cited data migration as the #1 execution risk
- Consensus: <2 week implementation is "technically aggressive" for system-of-record replacement
- Unanimous recommendation: Build automated migration scripts IMMEDIATELY

**3. CAC Will Increase Significantly**
- All three models agree: CAC will climb to $4,000-5,000 with SDRs (vs $1,200-3,000 founder-led)
- Consensus: Year 2 S&M budget needs 30-50% increase

**4. LinkedIn-Only GTM is Insufficient**
- All three models flagged LinkedIn's limitations in healthcare
- Consensus: Need to add conferences, referrals, and association partnerships
- Clinical directors operate via referrals, not cold LinkedIn outreach

**5. Prove Product-Market Fit Before Scaling**
- Unanimous: Do NOT hire SDRs until retention ≥90% after 3 billing cycles
- Consensus: Scaling sales before PMF = scaling churn

**6. 30min→30sec Validation is Critical**
- All models emphasize this as the "lynchpin" for premium pricing
- Must be validated with 3+ design partners in live clinic settings (not pilot data)

### 9.2 Points of Disagreement

**1. Churn Expectations (Significant Divergence)**

| Model | Monthly Churn | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **O3** | 4% Year 1 | New entrant without integrated payroll/billing, industry avg 1.5-2% for mature |
| **Gemini** | <1% target | PMS platforms are sticky; 3% signals "tool not platform" positioning failure |
| **Codex** | 5-7% Year 1 | Most pessimistic; cites lack of brand trust, aggressive for new entrants |

**Analysis:**
- Gemini is describing the **aspirational target** for a mature PMS
- O3 is describing **realistic Year 1** for a new entrant
- Codex is describing **worst-case Year 1** without strong product-market fit

**Synthesis:**
- Year 1: Expect 4-5% monthly (O3/Codex range)
- Year 2: Improve to 2-3% monthly (with product depth, multi-year contracts)
- Year 3+: Target <1.5% monthly (Gemini's sticky PMS benchmark)

**2. Starter Tier Pricing (Opposite Concerns)**

| Model | Concern | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **O3** | $499 TOO HIGH | Reduce to $299 to capture 30% of TAM (1-5 clinician agencies) |
| **Gemini** | $499 TOO LOW | Add usage caps to protect margin (AI inference costs) |
| **Codex** | Neutral | Consider usage-based or outcome-based pricing |

**Analysis:**
- O3 focused on **market capture** (don't exclude small clinics)
- Gemini focused on **unit economics** (don't lose money on small customers)
- Codex focused on **pricing innovation** (align price with value delivered)

**Synthesis:**
- Reduce Starter to $349 (compromise between $299 and $499)
- Add usage caps: 100 AI notes/month, 500 sessions/month
- Monitor margin: If <50%, increase price or tighten caps
- Offer outcome-based pricing as premium option: "Pay per hour saved"

### 9.3 Confidence Score Analysis

| Model | Score | Reasoning |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Gemini** | 8/10 | Highest confidence; strong healthcare SaaS expertise, detailed data migration analysis |
| **O3** | 7/10 | Mid-range; good ABA benchmarks, but acknowledges need for validation |
| **Codex** | 6/10 | Lowest confidence; lacks ABA-specific data, relies on general vertical SaaS experience |

**Aggregate Confidence: 7/10**

**Areas of Certainty:**
- Market opportunity is real ($3-5B, 4,000-6,000 clinics)
- AI differentiation is compelling (30min→30sec solves #1 burnout factor)
- Data migration is THE bottleneck (unanimous)
- CAC will increase with SDR hiring (unanimous)

**Areas of Uncertainty:**
- True AI efficacy in production (will 30min→30sec hold across all use cases?)
- Real churn rates for new entrant (4% vs 5-7% vs <1% target)
- Buyer responsiveness to AI premium pricing (will clinics pay $99 vs $80 legacy)
- Speed to SOC-2 compliance (6-12 month overhead)

### 9.4 Key Takeaways (Consensus Recommendations)

**CRITICAL - Do Before Launch:**
1. Build automated migration scripts for CentralReach/Catalyst
2. Validate 30min→30sec claim with 3+ design partners
3. Secure 5 design partners + 100 waitlist signups
4. Implement audit logging and HIPAA compliance checklist

**CRITICAL - Do in First 6 Months:**
1. Prove retention ≥90% before hiring SDRs
2. Attend 2-3 ABA conferences (address LinkedIn limitation)
3. Activate 5-10 RCM referral partnerships
4. Keep implementation <2 weeks (automated migration)

**CRITICAL - Do in Year 2:**
1. Increase S&M budget 30-50% (CAC will climb to $4-5K)
2. Improve churn from 4% to 2-3% (annual contracts, integration depth)
3. Generate 25-30% of customers via channel (reduce CAC)
4. Complete SOC-2 Type I audit by Month 20

**AVOID:**
1. Do NOT hire SDRs before 90% retention proven
2. Do NOT rely solely on LinkedIn outbound (add conferences, referrals)
3. Do NOT skip migration tooling (will destroy ROI claim)
4. Do NOT underestimate HIPAA/SOC-2 timeline (6-12 month overhead)

## Conclusion

The multi-model consensus analysis validates Omnirapeutic's core go-to-market strategy while identifying four critical risks that require immediate mitigation:

**Validated Strengths:**
1. AI differentiation (30min→30sec) is technically feasible and solves the #1 ABA clinician burnout factor
2. Target market (small-medium clinics, $3-5B TAM) is correctly sized and accessible
3. Pricing ($99/clinician) competitively undercuts incumbents while maintaining strong margins
4. GTM sequence (design partners → founder-led → SDR → team) follows SaaS best practices

**Critical Adjustments Required:**
1. **Data migration tooling must be built IMMEDIATELY** (not deferred to post-launch)
2. **Churn model revised:** 4-5% Year 1 → <2% Year 2 (requires annual contracts, integration depth)
3. **CAC budget increased 30-50%** Year 2 to account for SDR hiring ($4-5K vs $1.2-3K founder-led)
4. **GTM diversified beyond LinkedIn:** Add conferences, RCM partnerships, ABA associations

**Revised Financial Reality:**
- Year 1: 40 customers (vs 50), $480K ARR (vs $600K)
- Year 2: 160 customers (vs 200), $1.9M ARR (vs $2.4M), still cash-flow negative
- Year 3: 400 customers (vs 500), $4.8M ARR (vs $6M), 11% net margin (vs 20%)
- Funding required: $750K-1M seed (vs original $1M) with extended runway expectations

**Non-Negotiable Gates:**
1. Prove 30min→30sec with 3+ design partners BEFORE launch
2. Achieve ≥90% retention BEFORE hiring SDRs
3. Build automated migration scripts BEFORE first paying customer
4. Keep implementation <2 weeks to validate ROI claim

With these adjustments, Omnirapeutic's go-to-market strategy is **sound and executable**, with a realistic path to 400 customers and $4.8M ARR by Year 3.
